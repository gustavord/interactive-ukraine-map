# interactive-ukraine-map
This project is an interactive map of Ukraine in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict - you can interact with each individual oblast and draw arrows on the map. The program also includes features for saving and loading simulations.

## Saving and loading

To save any changes you have made to the map, click the save button. Two save files will be generated in the same folder the application is in (one for the regions and another for the drawn arrows).
They will be loaded automatically the next time the application is started.

If you want to restore the map to its initial state, simply delete or move the .save files from the folder.

## Thank you to the Unisinos Model United Nations (MUN) for inspiring and supporting this project.
